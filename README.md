# BeerpongVR

Beerpong VR is a small application developed by 2 students, Upd4ting and TheYoxy, in only one night.
As the name is saying, it's a small beerpong game into the mixed reality helmet, the [Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).

This game cares about the evironnement, so you'll have to scan the room to find a table where you'll play.
