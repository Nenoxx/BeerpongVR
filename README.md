# BeerpongVR

Beerpong VR is a small application developed by 2 students, [Upd4ting](https://github.com/Upd4ting) and [TheYoxy](https://github.com/TheYoxy), in only one night.
As the name is saying, it's a small beerpong game into the mixed reality helmet, the [Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).

This game cares about the evironnement, so you'll have to scan the room to find a table where you'll play.

Pictures are comming soon.
